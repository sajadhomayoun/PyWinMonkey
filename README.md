# PyWinMonkey  
WinMonkey helps you to work randomly on a specified windows program. After lunching PyWinMonkey, it performs clicks on your mentioned window to simulate user activity.  

### Lunching in command line:  
At first you should lunch your desired program manually and after that you should open command line and enter command as bellow:  
  
"python PyWinMonkey.py -w [Window Name] -c [Click Count=10] -s [Sleep Seconds Before Start=2]"  
  
Note #1: PyWinMonkey assumes you have already opened your specified program.  

### Examples:  
Assume we want to do 100 random clicks on notepad window.  

"python PyWinMonkey.py -w notepad -c 100 -s 5"  

Note #2: PyWinMonkey starts its work after -s seconds, it is useful in cases you want to open your program and let it to be on top of other windows.  

### PyWinMonkey is useful for:  
1) Lunching a program automatically and performing actions such as click, right click etc. on it,  
2) testing your software under click stress,  
3) we are working on many other capabilities!  

### You will need these libraries in python:  
1) pyautogui,  
2) win32gui.
